Hi, I'm Tony Davis. I'm a graduate student at Florida Atlantic University studying artificial intelligence. 

I am interested in the application of machine learning for insights into the natural world. In particular, graviational wave astronomy, quantum chemistry, and superconductivity. I believe the better we can understand nature, the better we will be able to live in harmony with it. I hope to use my knowledge of machine learning to discover actionable insights, not only theoretical knowledge.  

I want to collaborate on open source physics discovery projects such as nanograv and deepchem, but I would also like to contribute to bitcoin. Cryptocurrency has the power to greatly improve society through free and censorship resistent software. 

I have a background in mechanical engineering and 3 years of experience building robots. In my spare time, I scuba dive and enjoy long distance running. 

My personal email is acdavis629@gmail.com and my twitter is @TonyDavisFAU.
