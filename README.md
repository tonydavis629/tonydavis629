Hi, I'm Tony Davis. I'm a graduate student at Florida Atlantic University studying artificial intelligence. 

I am interested in the application of machine learning for insights into the natural world. In particular, my academic interests include genomics, molecular physics, and robotics. I believe the better we can understand nature, the better we will be able to live in harmony with it. I hope to use my knowledge of machine learning to discover actionable knowledge about microbiology in order to find workable solutions to climate change and human health. 

Currently I am still learning about the field of machine learning and I hope to contribute to open source projects such as biopython and deepchem in the near future.  

I have a background in mechanical engineering with 3 years of experience building robots, and I am a US Army veteran.  In my spare time, I scuba dive and enjoy long distance running. 

My personal email is acdavis629@gmail.com and my twitter is @TonyDavisFAU.
