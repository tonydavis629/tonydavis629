Hi, I'm Tony Davis. I'm a graduate student at Florida Atlantic University studying artificial intelligence. I have a background in mechanical engineering with 3 years of experience building robots, and I am a US Army veteran.  In my spare time, I scuba dive and enjoy long distance running. 

I am interested in the application of machine learning for robotic applications and scientific discovery. In particular, my academic interests include aquaculture robotics and deep learning. I believe the better we can understand nature, the better we will be able to design our technology to work in harmony with it. I hope to use my knowledge of machine learning and mechanical engineering to discover actionable knowledge in order to design workable solutions to climate change and human health. 

I hope to contribute to open source projects such as biopython and deepchem in the near future.
