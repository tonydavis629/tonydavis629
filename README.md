Hi, I'm Tony Davis. I'm a graduate student at Florida Atlantic University studying artificial intelligence. My background is in mechanical engineering, and I am a US Army veteran. In my spare time, I enjoy scuba diving, gardening and long distance running. 

I am interested in the application of machine learning for robotic applications and scientific discovery. In particular, my academic interests include marine robotics and deep learning. I believe the better we can understand nature, the better we will be able to design our technology to live in harmony with it. 

My personal email is acdavis629@gmail.com, twitter is @TonyD993, and personal website is [tonyd.co](https://tonyd.co).
