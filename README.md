Hi, I'm Tony Davis. I work at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. I recently graduated from Florida Atlantic University with a Master's in artificial intelligence. My background is in mechanical engineering, and I am a US Army veteran. In my spare time, I enjoy scuba diving, gardening and long distance running. 

I believe the better we can understand nature, the better we will be able to design our technology to live in harmony with it. 

My personal email is acdavis629@gmail.com, twitter is @TonyD993, and personal website is [tonyd.co](https://tonyd.co).
